# CHANGELOG

## Unreleased — 2D top-down classroom improvement

### Added
- Added a responsive Canvas 2D top-down renderer for the complete arena, including the snake, ordered character tokens, pulsing next-token ring, power-ups, bullets, grid, boundaries and environment obstacles.

### Changed
- Switched the active game presentation from the Three.js perspective scene to the 2D renderer without changing gameplay coordinates, controls, collision rules, vocabulary order, typing tests or scene progression.
- Preserved the deep ink-navy field, white grid lines, red warning boundaries/obstacles and 80% obstacle opacity in the new presentation.
- Kept device-pixel-ratio resizing, responsive canvas sizing, table tilt/shake feedback, backflip feedback and machine-readable render diagnostics.

## Unreleased — Playfield contrast adjustment

### Changed
- Recolored all environment playfields to a deep ink-navy floor with white grid lines.
- Recolored solid and wrap boundaries plus environment obstacles with red warning tones while preserving their existing gameplay and rendering distinctions.
- Removed the decorative central bottom table apron and label so the lower playfield remains visible.
- Removed the right-side decorative overlay rail and added a 0.9-unit visual clearance for token and power-up spawning near arena edges.
- Slimmed the physical boundary rail visuals while keeping their collision and wrap behavior unchanged.
- Made the desktop right HUD rail a transparent layout shell so its empty lower area no longer covers the playfield.
- Reduced the desktop recent-event card width, padding and text size to keep more of the lower-right playfield visible.
- Narrowed the desktop right HUD column to add more separation between mission information and the playfield.
- Added a pulsing high-contrast yellow ring around the next required playfield token while preserving ordered collection.
- Kept character tokens and power-ups visually readable above tall environment obstacles without changing their physical collision behavior.
- Replaced the always-on-top collectible rendering with moderately transparent environment obstacles, so behind-obstacle letters remain visible without appearing above the obstacles.
- Made collectible and obstacle rendering depth-aware so their front/back relationship remains visible through the transparency effect.
- Increased the main obstacle opacity to 80% for a clearer silhouette while retaining readable letters behind it.

## Version 1.9.1 — 2026-08-25

### Changed
- Added baked faceted light/dark panel shading to the mecha head and every body section without adding a lighting pass.
- Alternated primary and scene-accent body armor colors and section scale so neighboring sections remain visually distinct at the full-table camera distance.
- Enlarged the existing luminous section rings and raised the head armor/canopy layers for a clearer head-to-body silhouette without increasing the mecha draw-call count.
- Added browser diagnostics and regression coverage for the alternating panel pattern and energy-ring separators.
- Reorganized the desktop HUD into left operation/status, central playfield, and right mission/target regions so instructions do not cover the main game view; compact smaller-viewport behavior and all gameplay rules remain unchanged.
- Updated the specification, README and release metadata to Version 1.9.1.

## Version 1.9 — 2026-08-25

### Added
- Added an original classic space-pinball cabinet presentation with beveled metal frames, saturated cabinet panels, red-orange table rails, illuminated target lamps and high-impact score typography.
- Added five distinct cabinet, rail and lamp palettes that switch atomically with the existing environment themes.
- Added circular brushed-metal texture-atlas faces for all character tokens and power-ups, plus machine-readable visual-style diagnostics for release regression coverage.
- Created and verified a complete pre-change workspace archive and an all-references Git bundle before implementation.

### Changed
- Restyled vocabulary selection, gameplay HUD, transition, typing, failure, credits and audio controls with one coherent arcade cabinet drawing language while preserving the Chinese interface and all gameplay mechanics.
- Refined mecha, floor, grid, wall and obstacle colors toward silver hardware, deep cabinet blues, bright lamps and scene-specific highlights.
- Kept native-resolution performance within the release budget by simplifying full-viewport live-table compositing without reducing the detected device pixel ratio.
- Updated the specification, README and release metadata to Version 1.9.

### Security and provenance
- Used only repository-native CSS, Canvas and Three.js drawing; no third-party logos, trademarks or proprietary cabinet artwork were added.

## Version 1.8 — 2026-08-24

### Added
- Added five distinct procedural deep-space backgrounds: orbital-dock nebula, cryogenic star current, violet asteroid rift, gold-blue ion storm and emerald alien aurora.
- Added environment-linked mecha armor, canopy, engine glow, body energy rings, token frames, table rails and layered obstacle materials.
- Added separate, enlarged current-scene and total-run word progress to the main HUD.

### Changed
- Changed the five scene sizes to 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 words, for 75 unique words per completed run, and scaled scene timers to preserve the prior per-word difficulty curve.
- Replaced the player-selectable run seed with an automatically generated internal seed while retaining seeded gameplay systems.
- Enlarged selection, mission, target, telemetry, event, typing, failure and credits information with stronger contrast and scene-colored emphasis.
- Updated the specification, README and release metadata to Version 1.8.

### Removed
- Removed all visible development phase numbers, release/data versions, dataset counts and seed controls from player-facing screens.

## Version 1.7 — 2026-08-23

### Changed
- Changed dual-Shift table shaking from a latched two-second action to a hold action that continues for as long as both physical Shift keys remain pressed.
- Releasing either Shift now ends the shake immediately and resumes the remaining single-side tilt; releasing both returns the table to level.
- Removed the obsolete shake countdown from gameplay state, renderer diagnostics and the Traditional Chinese HUD, and updated release metadata and documentation to Version 1.7.

### Added
- Added deterministic unit and Chromium coverage proving shaking remains active beyond two seconds while held and stops immediately when either Shift is released.

## Version 1.6 — 2026-08-23

### Added
- Added physical left/right Shift detection: holding left Shift raises the left table edge and applies gravity toward player-view right, while holding right Shift raises the right edge and applies gravity toward player-view left until release.
- Added a single seeded two-second shake when both Shift keys are pressed together. The complete snake trail, tokens, power-ups and active bullets receive independent displacement while the table visibly wobbles and bounces.
- Added Traditional Chinese table-motion HUD status, concise control help, renderer diagnostics, deterministic unit coverage and Chromium interaction coverage.

### Changed
- Grouped the arena, environment and dynamic gameplay views under one Three.js table transform so physical tilt and shake remain local to the pinball table and keep the camera fixed.
- Added obstacle, SOLID-boundary and WRAP-aware table displacement without introducing collision death or changing the existing propulsion, typing, reward/penalty or state-machine rules.
- Updated the public specification, README and release metadata to Version 1.6.

## Version 1.5 — 2026-08-23

### Removed
- Removed the mini-map, expanded tactical radar, `M`/`Esc` map controls, quarter-speed map configuration and the now-unreachable `MAP_EXPANDED` state.
- Removed the separate right-side information panel and its large opaque backdrop.

### Changed
- Distributed mission metrics, vocabulary target, movement telemetry, event feedback and controls directly across the main game view as a transparent, responsive HUD.
- Kept the HUD backplates lightweight and non-blurred, reduced fixed-camera and repeated atlas-update work, and switched gameplay geometry to lower-cost palette materials so the native-resolution 1920×1080 scene retains the 30 FPS release floor.
- Added main-HUD position diagnostics so pause and backflip behavior remain verifiable without depending on radar data.
- Updated the Traditional Chinese controls, public specification, release metadata and automated coverage to Version 1.5.

### Added
- Chromium coverage confirming the old panel/radar are absent, `M` no longer changes gameplay state and native-resolution rendering remains intact.

## Version 1.4 — 2026-08-23

### Fixed
- Made tactical-radar requests during scene entry, stun and recovery queue visibly and open automatically when hunting resumes, eliminating the former silent no-op window.
- Added resize observation so both radar sizes redraw correctly after layout, viewport and device-resolution changes.

### Changed
- Moved the `J` escape backflip animation from the full-screen camera to the snake head and leading body while keeping the pinball-table camera fixed.
- Removed the 960×540 WebGL buffer cap and the radar's 2× cap; both canvases now use the full automatically detected device pixel ratio.
- Kept native-resolution performance above the 30 FPS release floor by using a lightweight full-screen floor shader while retaining lit mecha, wall and obstacle materials.
- Added player-view direction labels and the next required token to the expanded radar.

### Added
- Unit and Chromium coverage for queued radar opening, uncapped device-pixel-ratio detection, the fixed camera, mecha-only animation scope and native render-buffer dimensions.

## Version 1.3 — 2026-08-23

### Changed
- Raised the dynamic Three.js render-buffer budget from 800×450 to 960×540 (44% more pixels) for a sharper table, snake and token presentation while retaining the 30 FPS release floor in CI WebGL.
- Defined `W`/`↑`, `S`/`↓`, `A`/`←` and `D`/`→` from the fixed player's table position: forward/north, backward/south, left/west and right/east, independent of the current machine nose.
- Generalized the former relative rear maneuver into a safe two-corner completion whenever an absolute player-view request is directly opposite the current heading.
- Updated Traditional Chinese control help and public release metadata to Version 1.3.

### Added
- Unit and Chromium coverage for fixed player-view direction semantics, safe opposite-direction completion, the 960×540 render budget and retained 1920×1080 performance.

## Version 1.2 — 2026-08-23

### Added
- A physical `J`-key escape backflip that swaps the snake's tail into the new head, reverses the preserved trail, and points the new nose outward so it can leave a trap without curling inward.
- Five distinct interface themes tied to the five existing world palettes.
- Per-level movement speeds of 3.0, 3.75, 4.5, 5.25 and 6.0 units/sec from Game Level 1 through 5.
- Unit and Chromium coverage for preserved trail reversal, recovery/stun restrictions, monotonic speeds, unique themes and the visible first-level settings.

### Changed
- Slowed the default and first-level machine speed from 4.5 to 3.0 units/sec, with each later level faster than the previous one.
- Coupled the camera backflip to the gameplay escape maneuver and updated the Traditional Chinese control help and public release metadata to Version 1.2.

### Fixed
- Prevented the escape action from steering a head inward through its own body by deriving the new heading from the old tail's outward tangent.

## Version 1.1 — 2026-08-23

### Added
- A `↓` relative backward maneuver that completes a deterministic two-corner U-turn only after the snake has travelled one full segment spacing, preserving direct-reversal and anti-inward-curl protection.
- A `J`-key visual first-person backflip with synthesized feedback, duplicate-trigger protection and an exact return to the table pose without changing XZ physics or gameplay state.
- Unit and Chromium coverage for safe backward completion, ordinary reversal rejection, the pinball camera pose, the full backflip/reset cycle and both new keyboard controls.

### Changed
- Replaced the snake-eye follow camera with one fixed PerspectiveCamera at the player's end of the arena, angled down across the complete pinball table.
- Replaced the cockpit mask, struts and center reticle with slim table rails and an apron; the snake head is visible again from the new camera.
- Made batched token quads follow the camera's full orientation so labels remain readable from the angled table view and throughout a backflip.
- Updated the Traditional Chinese mission header, controls, pause-shield wording, browser description and public version metadata to Version 1.1.

### Removed
- Removed the former first-person cockpit/snake-eye presentation and its camera-turn smoothing.

### Fixed
- Refreshed radar position data immediately on state changes so pausing cannot briefly display a stale pre-pause sample.

## Version 1.0 / Phase 9 — 2026-08-23

### Added
- A Traditional Chinese `LEVEL_FAILED` mission report with alert-dialog semantics, focused return action, scene/progress context and a non-lethal rules reminder, eliminating the expired-timer dead end.
- Release-state regression tests covering the full success-to-credits/replay route, the stun/recovery/failure exit and the typing-test pause prohibition.
- A production artifact verifier for repository-subpath-safe references, required runtime data/assets and JavaScript/CSS size budgets; CI and GitHub Pages now run it after every production build.
- Chromium release gates for 1920×1080 frame rate, draw calls, internal render budget, browser/network errors, Traditional Chinese accessible names, focus, unique IDs and pause/resume state.
- Version 1.0 metadata and a repository-safe SVG favicon.

### Changed
- Batched all 30 token billboards into one dynamic texture-atlas mesh, reduced live telemetry DOM updates to 10 Hz and exposed render diagnostics for repeatable performance checks.
- Added a dynamic 800×450 internal pixel budget, high-performance WebGL preference and lower-cost live overlays while keeping the cockpit canvas at full viewport size.
- Added explicit release-version and game-state diagnostics to the application root and replaced the remaining English completion status with Traditional Chinese.
- Added bounded timeouts to CI and Pages jobs and advanced browser metadata, accessibility text, default seed and visible phase markers to Phase 9.

### Fixed
- Prevented duplicate start actions outside `VOCABULARY_SELECT` and disposed both success and failure terminal presentation before replay.
- Refreshed the Chinese simulation-state indicator immediately on pause/resume so visibility-triggered pauses cannot leave stale telemetry when the render timer is suspended.
- Preserved all core mechanics during release hardening, including non-lethal collision recovery, snake length rewards/penalties, three consecutive typing successes, independent Game/Vocabulary levels, active tactical-map simulation and the complete mini-map trail.

## Phase 8 — 2026-08-22

### Added
- A dependency-free Web Audio presentation layer with synthesized feedback for menus, tokens, collisions, power-ups, weapons, typing, pause/resume, scene entry and mission completion.
- Five distinct low-level ambient soundscapes, one per environment, plus a Traditional Chinese sound toggle whose mute preference persists in localStorage and degrades safely to silent play when audio is unavailable.
- Animated cockpit-door cards for every scene entry, user pause/resume, visibility-triggered automatic pause and final mission completion, with reduced-motion handling.
- A KOSMOS TOOLKITS 探真拓知酷 credits screen summarizing all five environments and 25 completed words, with a clean return to vocabulary/seed selection for replay.
- Typed gameplay presentation events and unit/Chromium coverage for audio definitions, mute persistence, collection/impact cues, exact-state pause/resume, visibility behavior, doors and credits.

### Changed
- Made `TRANSITION_IN` a real timer-pausing state between scenes instead of transitioning through it synchronously.
- Added `P` pause/resume for normal gameplay and automatic pause when the document becomes hidden; typing tests remain real-time and cannot be paused with `P`.
- Advanced browser metadata, accessibility text, default seed and visible phase markers to Phase 8.

### Fixed
- Preserved the exact prior `HUNTING`, `STUNNED`, `RECOVERY`, or `MAP_EXPANDED` state across pause/resume and delayed state restoration until the door-open animation completes.
- Reset transient run presentation and initial snake length before replay so a completed mission can begin a clean new run without duplicated HUD elements.

## Phase 7 — 2026-08-22

### Added
- Five typed environment profiles for Cargo Bay, Ship Pipeline, Asteroid Belt, Dense Atmosphere and Alien Forest with distinct palettes, fog ranges, obstacle layouts and Traditional Chinese mechanism labels.
- Instanced Three.js cargo, pipe, asteroid, pressure-pylon and alien-tree treatments that switch with the active Game Level.
- Solid environment geometry in snake collision, seeded token/power-up spawning, projectile impact and both radar sizes.
- Scene-start notifications plus unit and Chromium coverage for five-environment completeness, arena capacity, switching, collision, bullet blocking and live Cargo Bay markers.

### Changed
- Advanced browser metadata, default seed and visible phase markers to Phase 7.
- Reset the snake pose and trail to the safe arena center between scenes while preserving earned length and cumulative ammo.
- Rebuilt tokens and power-ups outside each new obstacle field and cleared only active bullets during scene changes.
- Reported environment mechanics, obstacle collisions and obstacle shot impacts in the Chinese cockpit HUD.

## Phase 6 — 2026-08-22

### Added
- A single snake-eye PerspectiveCamera rig with short heading-change smoothing and no stereo-rendering dependency.
- A fixed cockpit mask, horizon accents and central targeting reticle around the Three.js scene.
- A lower-left mini-map that distinguishes SOLID and WRAP boundaries and shows all tokens, power-ups, active bullets, future obstacle markers, the snake head and the complete snake trail.
- Click and `M` controls for an enlarged tactical map, plus `Esc` and `M` close controls and a visible 0.25× status indicator.
- Unit and Chromium coverage for camera behavior, tactical-map state/input, complete-trail radar data and continued quarter-speed gameplay.

### Changed
- Advanced browser metadata, default seed and visible phase markers to Phase 6.
- Made `MAP_EXPANDED` an active gameplay state whose fixed-step simulation and main timer run at 0.25 speed; steering, collection and firing remain available.
- Replaced the temporary isometric camera and diagnostic layout with the cockpit view and right-side Chinese mission HUD.
- Hid the rendered snake head from the first-person scene while retaining the full snake on the mini-map and tactical map.

### Known Issues
- Phase 7's five functional environments are not implemented; every Game Level still uses the existing cargo arena.

## Phase 5 — 2026-08-22

### Added
- Persistent seeded arena pool containing one each of +10, +5, −10, −5 and ATTACK without overlapping the snake, tokens or other power-ups.
- Signed numeric power-up effects for the scene main timer; negative adjustments reaching zero use the existing non-lethal level-failed flow.
- Cumulative ATTACK rewards of five rounds and Space-key firing restricted to `HUNTING`.
- Fixed-step projectile movement across WRAP axes, four-second safety expiry and removal on SOLID-wall impact.
- Shot-token and shot-power-up repositioning that never advances vocabulary progress or activates the struck power-up.
- Three.js power-up labels and projectile rendering plus Traditional Chinese ammo, power-up and shot telemetry.
- Unit and Chromium coverage for Phase 5 spawn, collection, ammo, firing, impact and browser-HUD behavior.

### Changed
- Advanced browser metadata, default seed and visible phase markers to Phase 5.
- Extended shared spawn occupancy so future token respawns avoid all live power-ups.

### Known Issues
- The current isometric scene and telemetry overlay remain temporary until the cockpit HUD and mini-map work in Phase 6.

## Phase 4 — 2026-08-22

### Added
- Traditional Chinese typing reinforcement modal with target, Chinese meaning, real-time countdown, streak, feedback and auto-focused input.
- Thirty-second absolute-time `TypingTestSession` that remains accurate across animation pauses and hidden-tab intervals.
- Case-insensitive answer comparison after trimming leading/trailing whitespace while preserving exact internal spaces, periods, apostrophes and hyphens.
- Three-consecutive-success progression with immediate streak reset after every wrong submission.
- Enter-key/form submission and copy/cut/paste prevention scoped only to the typing modal.
- Typing-timeout recovery that rolls back only the final token and adds five seconds to the scene timer.
- Unit and Chromium coverage for comparison, streaks, timeout, rollback, keyboard submission, focus and clipboard scope.

### Changed
- Advanced browser metadata and visible phase markers to Phase 4.
- Suspended movement input throughout `TYPING_TEST` and restored it only when gameplay returns to `HUNTING`.
- Completed the existing word/scene progression hook so a successful typing test continues the 25-word run through `GAME_CLEAR`.

### Removed
- Removed the custom 20-second no-progress deadline, final-10-second HUD warning and automatic current-level restart. The configured scene main timer remains the only hunting time limit.

### Fixed
- Typing time now uses an absolute `performance.now()` deadline instead of the fixed-step gameplay clock, so hiding the page cannot pause the test.
- Prevented rapid two-corner input from bypassing direct-reversal protection and curling the snake head inward; U-shaped turns now require one segment spacing of forward travel, with one safe stationary turn retained during recovery.

### Known Issues
- Power-ups, weapon and ammo remain intentionally unavailable until Phase 5.
- The current isometric scene and telemetry overlay remain temporary until the cockpit HUD and mini-map work in Phase 6.

## Phase 3 — 2026-08-22

### Added
- Traditional Chinese browser metadata, boot flow, vocabulary selection, HUD labels, state feedback, controls and accessibility text.
- A 20-second no-progress deadline that resets after every correct token, displays an urgent final-10-second countdown, and restarts the current Game Level on expiry without rerolling its vocabulary.
- Full level-restart restoration for scene time, first-word progress, snake position/direction/length and the 30-token pool.
- Independent vocabulary selection for CEEC Level 1–6, PROGRESSIVE and MIXED 1–6 modes.
- Seeded deterministic random source shared by word selection and spawning; gameplay call sites do not use `Math.random()`.
- Five-scene × five-word run planning with unique ids/targets, scene token-length limits and the specified Progressive mapping.
- Recent-target filtering with the required relaxation order: history first, then maximum token length one token at a time.
- Central SpawnManager with 100 bounded random attempts, deterministic fallback points, arena/body/entity exclusion and four-unit head clearance.
- Runtime token pool containing A–Z plus SPACE, PERIOD, APOSTROPHE and HYPHEN at each new word.
- Ordered token collection, repeated-token immediate respawn, correct shortening and wrong-token growth/stun/respawn.
- Scene main timer and Phase 3 handoff to `TYPING_TEST` after a word is fully collected.
- A Phase 4-facing success hook that advances words and scenes, resets each new scene timer, and reaches `GAME_CLEAR` after word 25.
- Three.js token sprites, pulsing target token, vocabulary selection screen and progress/meaning/level telemetry.
- Unit and E2E coverage for selection, spawning, pool normalization, token outcomes, no-progress restart behavior and the Traditional Chinese Phase 3 browser flow.

### Changed
- Advanced the boot flow through `VOCABULARY_SELECT` before entering `HUNTING`.
- Distinguished wrong-token stun from wall/self collision: wrong tokens return directly to hunting, while wall/self collisions retain RECOVERY.
- Updated the browser title, documentation and test expectations to Phase 3.

### Fixed
- Preserved timer pause and stationary movement at the Phase 4 typing-test boundary without implementing the typing test early.

### Known Issues
- Phase 3 stops after the first completed word because the required three-success typing reinforcement is Phase 4.
- The current isometric scene and telemetry overlay are temporary; the final cockpit HUD and mini-map belong to Phase 6.

## Phase 2 — 2026-08-22

### Added
- Continuous cardinal snake movement on the horizontal XZ plane at a fixed 1/60 simulation step.
- Recorded polyline trail sampling so body segments follow turns at 0.75-unit spacing rather than moving in grid jumps.
- Central snake configuration for initial/minimum/maximum length, speed, spacing and collision radii.
- Per-axis `SOLID` and `WRAP` arena boundaries with per-segment wrap presentation.
- Predictive SOLID wall and self-collision detection, including wrap-aware seam distance.
- Non-lethal 1-second `STUNNED` and 500 ms stationary `RECOVERY` state sequence; recovery allows steering.
- Keyboard steering through WASD and arrow keys with direct 180-degree reversal rejection.
- Instanced Three.js body rendering and an interactive Phase 2 movement-lab scene.
- Unit and E2E coverage for movement, trail behavior, wrapping, collisions, delay states and input rules.

### Changed
- Expanded the explicit main state transition map for Phase 2 collision states and future spec-defined states.
- Replaced the Phase 1 rotating-primitive smoke screen with a functional movement sandbox.
- Updated the development status, controls and architecture documentation for Phase 2.

### Fixed
- Removed the Phase 1-only scene loop in favor of a clamped fixed-step gameplay accumulator.

### Known Issues
- The Phase 2 isometric camera and diagnostic overlay are temporary development presentation; the cockpit HUD and mini-map belong to later phases.
- Vocabulary targets, token spawning and collection are intentionally not implemented until Phase 3.

## Phase 1 — 2026-08-22

### Added
- Vanilla Vite and TypeScript project scaffold with Three.js, Vitest, Playwright and `tsx`.
- Typed `VocabularyRepository` with runtime schema checks, metadata, counts, eligible-entry filtering and typed load errors.
- Responsive Phase 1 boot screen with a continuously rendered Three.js smoke scene and vocabulary status/counts.
- Vitest coverage for vocabulary schema, levels, tokens, token lengths, counts and malformed data.
- Playwright boot smoke test for the UI, vocabulary load and WebGL canvas.
- GitHub Actions workflows for CI, browser smoke testing and validated GitHub Pages deployment.
- Project setup, data workflow, test and deployment documentation.

### Changed
- Wired runtime vocabulary loading through the GitHub Pages-safe `import.meta.env.BASE_URL` path.
- Promoted Phase 0 package-script requirements into the root project package configuration.

### Fixed
- None.

### Known Issues
- Phase 0 source ambiguities remain intentionally preserved in the vocabulary import report for manual review.
- The Phase 1 scene is a technical smoke screen only; gameplay starts in Phase 2 or later as defined by the specification.

## Phase 0 — 2026-08-22

### Added
- CEEC Level 1–6 source PDF reference.
- Parsed source-row JSON with page/column provenance.
- Normalized runtime vocabulary JSON.
- Vocabulary import report and review queue.
- TypeScript vocabulary types, normalizer, importer and validator.
- `SPEC.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and Phase 1 Codex handoff instructions.

### Changed
- Vocabulary and game level are explicitly independent.
- Gameplay token set is A–Z plus SPACE, PERIOD, APOSTROPHE and HYPHEN.

### Known Issues
- The source PDF mixes slash variants, multiple senses and inline synonym annotations; therefore parsed source-row counts are not identical to the source heading’s 1,080-words label.
- Entries requiring manual audit are preserved and listed in `public/data/vocabulary-import-report.json`.
